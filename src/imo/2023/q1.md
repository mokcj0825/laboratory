# Question

Determine all composite integers $n \gt 1$ that satisfy the following property: if $d_1, d_2,...,d_k$ are all the positive divisors of $n$ with $1 = d_1 \lt d_2 \lt ... \lt d_k = n$, then $d_i$ divides $d_{i+1} + d_{i+2}$ for every $1 \leq i \leq k-2$.

# Analysis of Tricky Aspects

### 1. Composite Numbers Only
- We only consider non-prime numbers > 1
- Each number must have at least 3 divisors (1, itself, and at least one more)
- This actually helps narrow down our search space

### 2. Divisor Ordering Requirement
- All divisors must be strictly increasing: $d_1 \lt d_2 \lt ... \lt d_k$
- First and last divisors are fixed: $d_1 = 1$ and $d_k = n$
- No repeated divisors allowed (strict inequality)

### 3. Main Property's Complexity
- For each $d_i$, we need to check if it divides $(d_{i+1} + d_{i+2})$
- This creates a chain of divisibility conditions
- Must check this for ALL $i$ from 1 to $k-2$
- Each number needs to satisfy multiple divisibility conditions simultaneously

### 4. Chain of Conditions
- For a number with $k$ divisors, we need to check $k-2$ conditions
- Each condition involves three consecutive divisors
- These conditions are interconnected - satisfying one might make it harder to satisfy others

### 5. Hidden Challenge
- The sum of two larger divisors $(d_{i+1} + d_{i+2})$ must be divisible by a smaller divisor $(d_i)$
- This is counter-intuitive as usually in number theory, larger numbers divide smaller ones
- This reversal of the usual divisibility direction makes the problem more challenging

### 6. Finding All Solutions
- Need to find ALL numbers that satisfy these conditions
- Must prove we haven't missed any solutions
- Must prove that our solutions actually work

## You can ignore this.

- Why primes excluded?
- Why we need to sort divisor?
- 1 will not be added, and how we can confirm, the "first n value are capable to divide their following values sum"?
- Can we conclude something now?
- How we prove it?

## Please ignore this.

1. For $n = p^k$ where k â‰¥ 2:
   - All divisors are: $d_1 = 1, d_2 = p, d_3 = p^2, ..., d_{k+1} = p^k$
   - For any i from 1 to k-1:
     * $d_i = p^{i-1}$
     * $d_{i+1} = p^i$
     * $d_{i+2} = p^{i+1}$
   - Then $d_{i+1} + d_{i+2} = p^i + p^{i+1} = p^i(1 + p)$
   - Clearly $d_i = p^{i-1}$ divides $p^i(1 + p)$

2. If n has two different prime factors:
   - Let $n = p^a q^b$ where p, q are different primes
   - Some consecutive divisors will be:
     * $p^x$ and $p^x q^y$ and $p^z q^w$
   - Their sum won't maintain the divisibility pattern
   - Because mixing different primes breaks the power pattern
