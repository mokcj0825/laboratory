# Question

Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB < AC$. Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $S$ be the midpoint of the arc $CB$ of $\Omega$ containing $A$. The perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$ meets $BS$ at $D$ and meets $\Omega$ again at $E \neq A$. The line through $D$ parallel to $BC$ meets line $BE$ at $L$. Denote the circumcircle of triangle $BDL$ by $\omega$. Let $\omega$ meet $\Omega$ again at $P \neq B$. 
Prove that the line tangent to $\omega$ at $P$ meets the line $BS$ on the internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.

# Analysis of Tricky Aspects

### 1. Initial Setup Complexity
- Triangle $ABC$ must be acute-angled (first restriction)
- $AB < AC$ (second restriction)
- These conditions are likely crucial for the proof
- Need to understand why these specific conditions are needed

### 2. Multiple Constructions in Sequence
- $S$: midpoint of arc $CB$ containing $A$
- $D$: intersection of altitude from $A$ and $BS$
- $E$: second intersection point on $\Omega$
- $L$: intersection of $BE$ and line through $D$ parallel to $BC$
- $P$: second intersection point of circles $\omega$ and $\Omega$
- Each construction builds on previous ones
- Missing or misplacing one point affects all subsequent steps

### 3. Two Interacting Circles
- $\Omega$: circumcircle of $ABC$ (the main circle)
- $\omega$: circumcircle of $BDL$ (the derived circle)
- Their intersection points ($B$ and $P$) are crucial
- Common properties to consider:
  * Power of a point theorems
  * Angle properties in intersecting circles
  * Common tangent relationships

### 4. Complex Goal with Multiple Elements
- Need to prove about the tangent at point $P$
- This tangent intersects line $BS$
- The intersection point lies on angle bisector of $\angle BAC$
- Three different geometric objects meeting at one point:
  * A tangent line
  * A line through points $B$ and $S$
  * An angle bisector

### 5. Hidden Properties and Relationships
- Midpoint of arc ($S$) often connects to:
  * Angle bisector properties
  * Inscribed angle theorems
  * Isosceles triangle properties
- Parallel line to $BC$ through $D$ suggests:
  * Similar triangles
  * Proportional segments
  * Parallel line theorems
- Altitude and circumcircle intersection ($E$) hints at:
  * Cyclic quadrilateral properties
  * Right angle relationships
  * Power of a point applications

### 6. Proof Strategy Challenges
- Need to connect multiple geometric concepts
- Many possible approaches to consider:
  * Angle chasing
  * Similar triangles
  * Circle properties
- Must choose the most efficient path to proof
- Need to use all given conditions effectively

## Some drafts
1. Triangle $ABC$ exists.
2. Circle $\Omega$ is the circumcircle.
3. $AB < AC$.
4. $S$ is located at longer $BC$ arc, it is midpoint of arc $BC$. This arc is $BSAC$.
5. $AD \perp BC$, $D$ is the point on straight line $BS$, not the arc. So, $BDS$ is a straight line.
6. $AED$ is a straight line.
7. $E$ is another intersection point on $\Omega$.
8. A line through $D$, parallel to $BC$, meets $BE$ at $L$.
9. $DL \parallel BC$, and $BEL$ is a straight line.
10. The $BDL$ forms a new circle, we call it $\omega$.
11. $P$ and $B$ are the intersection points of $\Omega$ and $\omega$.
12. Any point in longer arc $BC$ gives equal angles to $\angle BAC$. So, $\angle BSC = \angle BAC$.
13. Let us draw line $TP$. $BTS$ is collinear, $TP$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $P$.
14. Let us extend $TP$ to $Q$, where $Q$ is another intersection with $\Omega$.
15. Now, where is point $T$?
16. Consider if $\angle STO + \angle OST = 180^\circ$?

### Circle Properties
1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**
   - An inscribed angle is half the central angle that subtends the same arc
   - All inscribed angles intercepting the same arc are equal
   - The inscribed angle in a semicircle is $90^\circ$

2. **Tangent-Chord Properties**
   - The angle between a tangent and a chord at the point of contact equals the angle in the alternate segment
   - If $TP$ is tangent at $P$, then $\angle TPB$ equals the angle in the alternate segment

3. **Midpoint of Arc Properties**
   - If $S$ is the midpoint of arc $BC$, then:
     * $\angle BSC = \angle BAC$ (inscribed angle theorem)
     * $OS$ bisects $\angle BAC$ (where $O$ is circle center)
     * $BS = SC$ (equal chords)

4. **Power of a Point**
   - If a line from point $Q$ intersects a circle at points $P$ and $R$:
     * $QP \times QR$ is constant for all such lines
   - If $QT$ is tangent to circle at $T$:
     * $QT^2 = QP \times QR$

5. **Collinearity**
   - Three points are collinear if and only if:
     * The sum of angles between them is $180^\circ$
     * They lie on the same straight line
