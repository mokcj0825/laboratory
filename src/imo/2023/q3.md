# Question

For each integer $k \geq 2$, determine all infinite sequences of positive integers $a_1, a_2,...$ for which there exists a polynomial $P$ of the form $P(x) = x^k+c_{k-1}x^{k-1}+...+c_1x+c_0$, where $c_0, c_1,...,c_{k-1}$ are non-negative integers, such that 
$$P(a_n) = a_{n+1}a_{n+2}...a_{n+k}$$
for every integer $n \geq 1$.

# Analysis of Tricky Aspects

### 1. Sequence Properties
- Must be an infinite sequence of positive integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$
- For any $a_n$, its $k$-th power (plus lower terms) equals product of NEXT $k$ terms
- $a_n^k + c_{k-1}a_n^{k-1} + ... + c_1a_n + c_0 = a_{n+1}a_{n+2}...a_{n+k}$
- This creates a "forward-looking" relationship

### 2. Growth Rate Relationship
- Left side: dominated by $a_n^k$ term
- Right side: product of next $k$ terms
- Since $c_i \geq 0$, we know $a_n^k \leq a_{n+1}a_{n+2}...a_{n+k}$
- This constrains how sequence can behave

### 3. Polynomial Constraints
- Degree exactly $k$ with leading coefficient 1
- All coefficients $c_0, c_1, ..., c_{k-1}$ must be non-negative integers
- Same polynomial must work for ALL terms in sequence
- Lower terms affect the exact relationship

### 4. Pattern Recognition
- Need to find ALL possible sequences
- Each term determines next $k$ terms via polynomial
- Sequence can't grow too fast (due to $k$-th power vs product)
- Sequence can't shrink (all terms must be positive)

### 5. Key Questions to Consider
- Could all terms be equal?
- If terms change, how can they change?
- What relationship between consecutive terms would work?
- How do the non-negative coefficients restrict possibilities?

### 6. Solution Strategy
- Start with the simplest case ($k=2$)
- Look for patterns that could work for all $k$
- Consider extreme cases (minimum/maximum growth)
- Need to prove both existence and uniqueness

### 7. Proof Requirements
- Must work for ALL $k \geq 2$
- Must find ALL possible sequences
- Must prove no other sequences exist
- Solution must handle arbitrary large $k$

## Drafts
1. We have a sequences, $a, a_1, a_2, a_3,...$
2. We have a $k$-degree polynomial, and all constants are larger than 0.
3. The requirement is...For example, the sequence is $1, 3, 5, 7, 9,...$, and $k = 3$. So $P(1) = 3 * 5 * 7$
4. Expectation: $a_{n+1} * a_{n+2} * a_{n+3} * ... * a_{n+k} = a_n^k + Ca_n^{k-1} + Ca_n^{k-2} + ... + C$
5. Start from small. Let $k = 2$ So $a_{n+1} * a_{n+2} = a_n^2 + Ca_n + C$.
6. If $A$ is constants, C must be zero to let the equation valid.
7. Let us remove the restriction of $k = 2$, and denote $a_{n+1} = (a_n - K_1)$. 
8. We get $(a_n - K_1)(a_n - K_2)...(a_n - K_k) = a_n^k + Ca_n^{k-1} + Ca_n^{k-2} + ... + C$.
9. It will be... $a_n^k + (\sum K_i)a_n^{k-1} + (\text{sum of products of }K_i\text{ taken 2 at a time})a_n^{k-2} + ... + (K_1K_2...K_k)$
10. If $A$ become smaller, LHS coefficient will have ~half is negative. This violates the statement C are non-negative integers.
11. Let $(a_n + K_1)(a_n + K_2)...(a_n + K_k) = a_n^k + Ca_n^{k-1} + Ca_n^{k-2} + ... + C$, if $A$ become larger.
12. We use minimum $k=2$
13. For the LHS: $(a_n + K_1)(a_n + K_2)$
14. For the RHS: $a_n^2 + c_1a_n + c_2$
15. If $a_n = 1$, LHS become: $1 + K_1 + K_2 + K1_K2; RHS = 1 + c1 + c2$
16. Since $A$ is increasing, LHS should have minimum 6, RHS should have minimum 2. It violates the condition.
17. Thus, $A$ must be constant.
